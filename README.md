Quota Management API
--------------------

Quota Management API is for helping webapps to manage their storage data
stored on the user's local device more wisely and efficiently.
Namely, the API is aiming to enable:

* Webapps to **query the current data usage**, i.e. how much data is stored by the app on the user's local device,
* Webapps to **request a new storage quota** to store bigger data in a way that the UA and the user can agree with, and
* Webapps to **efficiently manage their data** when the remaining available space on the user's local device is getting tight.

Currently it's in FPWD status.
